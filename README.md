#  DSA Mastery Journey with C++

This repository tracks my progress through the **Apna College DSA Masterclass** (126 Videos). My goal is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

# Repository Roadmap
I have organized my learning into specific modules:

* [01-Fundamentals-and-Math](./01-Fundamentals-and-Math): Basic syntax, logic, and number theory.
* [02-Arrays-Basics](./02-Arrays-Basics): Fundamental array operations and linear searching.
* [03-Sorting-Algorithms](./03-Sorting-Algorithms): Implementing Bubble, Selection, and Insertion sort.
* [04-Searching-and-Binary-Search](./04-Searching-and-Binary-Search): Binary search and its various applications.
* [05-Advanced-Array-Techniques](./05-Advanced-Array-Techniques): Subarray logic, Kadane's Algorithm, and optimization problems.
* [06-Binary-Search-on-Answers](./06-Binary-Search-on-Answers):Aggressive cow, Book allocation, Painter partision.
* [07-Strings-and-Char-Arrays](./07-Strings-and-Char-Arrays):Palindrome, Permutation In String, Remove All Occurrence, Reverse String, Reverse Word In String, String Compression.
* [08-Maths_For_DSA](./08-Maths_For_DSA):Armstrong, Digit In Number, GCD, LCM, Prime Check, Reverse Number, Sieve Of Eratosthenes.
